# Requirements

To develop Interbit applications, your development environment needs the
following software:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.6 or higher
* [NPM](https://nodejs.org/) 5.8 or higher

We also recommend the following, optional npm packages for developing Interbit
applications:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) 6.0.0 or higher (eventually 7.0)
* [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) 2.5.1 or higher
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) 3.3 or higher
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) 20.0.4 (specifically)

Once you have these requirements installed, see how to [install the Interbit
SDK](install.md).
