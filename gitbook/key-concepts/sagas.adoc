= Root Saga

Because a smart contract must be deterministic a method of handling side
effects on a blockchain must be used. Interbit uses the `redux-saga` API
to manage side effects. If you require side effect management in your
covenant simply export a `rootSaga` in your covenant package export in
the same way you would export a Redux saga.

documentation for implementation details.
