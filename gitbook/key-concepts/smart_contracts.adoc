= Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts provide the programmability and customizability of
Interbit. Smart Contracts must be written in JavaScript and must be
developed using deterministic, functional programming methodology.

Below is an implementation of a simple Smart Contract that increments a
counter by an amount whenever an `ADD` action is received.
For context, the action and state are also given.

[source,jsx]
----
var state = { sum: 5 }

var action = {
  type: 'ADD',
  payload: { amount: 5 }
}

var smartContract = {
  incrementSum: (state, action) => {
    var newState = {
        sum: state.sum + action.payload.amount
    }
    return newState
  }
}

We have supplied a code exercise of a simple smart contract that should
increment a counter by the amount defined in the `ADD` action payload
when it is received. For context, the action and state are given.

[NOTE]
======
**Exercise Context**

[source,js]
----
  var state = { sum: 5 }

  var action = {
    type: 'ADD',
    payload: { amount: 5 }
  }
----
======

{% exercise %}
Write a smart contract to increment the sum contained in the state for
the action described above.

{% initial %}
  var smartContract = {
    incrementSum: (state, action) => {
      // TODO

      return state
    }
  }

{% solution %}
  var smartContract = {
    incrementSum: (state, action) => {
      var newState = {
          sum: state.sum + action.payload.amount
      }
      return newState
    }
  }

{% validation %}
  assert(smartContract.incrementSum(state, action).sum === 10 && state.sum === 5)

{% context %}
  var action = {
    type: 'ADD',
    payload: {
      amount: 5
    }
  }

  var state = {
    sum: 5
  }

{% endexercise %}

[WARNING]
=========
**Assertion failed?**

If your assertion has failed, double check that your smart contract is
not mutating the existing state and is instead returning a new state.
