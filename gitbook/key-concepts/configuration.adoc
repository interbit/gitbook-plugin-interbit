= Configuration and Manifest File

Interbit uses a link:/reference/interbit-cli/config.md[configuration]
file so that you can describe your entire blockchain network in a single
place. This file allows you to generate and manage networks based on the
constraints described in the configuration.

The link:/reference/interbit-cli/manifest.md[manifest] file is generated
during the link:/reference/interbit-cli/build.md[`interbit build`] step
to describe a fully resolved and deployable blockchain network.
