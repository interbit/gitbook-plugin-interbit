= Covenants

A covenant is a set of link:action.adoc[action] creators and types, a
reducer (which is a link:smart_contracts.adoc[smart contract], and a
Redux link:sagas.adoc[saga] that together indicate the functioning of an
Interbit blockchain. These actions, smart contract, and saga work
together to fulfill the functionality of a single Interbit blockchain.
The `rootSaga` in a smart contract is optional.

A covenant should be packaged as an npm module but does not necessarily
have to be published anywhere to run on the Interbit blockchain.
