# Examples

To get started, we've included four examples.

The Introductory Project is as simple as an application can be, continuing from the Getting Started steps.

The Determinism example illustrates how to deterministically deal with non-determinism.

The To Do List is a basic application and a good starting point for a first blockchain application. This interactive example will help familiarize a developer with the technologies used by Interbit: JavaScript, Redux, and blockchain.

Order Books is a more in-depth, descriptive example that includes a web server and user interface in addition to a basic application. These examples demonstrate how to incorporate a user interface into an application, and show greater smart contract complexity.

These examples cover:
1. getting the existing example running
2. the components of the application and what they do

Additionally, the To Do List covers:
1. the process of adding a feature with help
2. tests to aid in adding your own feature without help
3. a summary of the example
